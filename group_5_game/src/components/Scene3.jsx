                You arrive at a quaint village bathed in warm sunlight. The cobblestone streets are 
                lined with small cottages, each with a garden of blooming flowers. Villagers greet 
                you warmly, inviting you to rest and share a meal.
            </p>
            <p>What will you do next? Say "go to Scene 1" to return to the crossroads or "go to Scene 2" to head into the forest.</p>
