                You find yourself in a shadowy forest. The trees are tall and ancient, their branches 
                forming a thick canopy overhead. The air smells of moss and earth. Somewhere in the 
                distance, you hear the faint rustle of leaves.
            </p>
            <p>What will you do next? Say go to Scene 1 to return to the crossroads or "go to Scene 3" to explore further.</p>
